# Automatic-irrigation-for-garden
Developed a home automation system using Arduino as a physical world sensor to detect body presence at a distance. The system uses a PIR sensor to detect the infrared radiation emitted by human bodies. When the PIR sensor detects a body, it sends a signal to the Arduino. The Arduino then takes appropriate action, such as turning on the lights, unlocking the door, or playing music.
The system is low-cost and easy to install. It can be used to automate a variety of tasks in the home,
